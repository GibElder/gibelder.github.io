        Outside of work, I enjoy spending time outdoors, fishing, and exploring new places. I’m also an avid gamer and enjoy building my own hardware and software projects in my free time. I’m passionate about cybersecurity and artificial intelligence and love working on systems that combine both fields to solve challenging problems. Whether I’m designing secure infrastructure or experimenting with machine learning models, I’m always driven by curiosity and a desire to learn and create.
